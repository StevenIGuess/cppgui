# C++ GUI

# ATTENTION THIS CODE IS PROBABLY NOT SAFE
13 year old me might have been an idiot im not sure. Run this code under your own responsability.

Fist C++ GUI.

I don't know what I did here, I coded this thing when I was like 13 years old lol.

## Installing the thing

Release.exe is an installer, but I wouldn't trust that thing. Just download the Release folder and execute the main.exe file.
You can also rebuild the entire thing using visual studio.

## Getting started

It's like scratch but in bad.
Open the Programm and enter "Color:" in the text box.
Now press box one.
Now press box two.
Enter "Blue", "Red", "Black" or "Grey" into the text box.
Press box one.
Press box two.
Press run.
Now the background turns into the color that you entered.
